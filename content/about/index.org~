I am a Pittsburgh based designer and currently Head of Design at a tiny startup called [[https:likenow.org][LikeNow]] In my free time I volunteer at Edgewood Volunteer Fire Department and advise a few startups.

I've founded companies like [[https:legalsifter.com][LegalSifter]] that has raised over 6MM to date from institutional investors and grew the company from myself to 25 employees and 50kMRR. I started the first coworking space in Pittsburgh, and grew that to a 5,000sqf space with nearly 100 members and despite all the titles I could have taken and often use, such as founder, CEO, GM, I still call myself a designer because I attribute the success of all of my projects to the level of empathy and advocacy I learned when becoming a designer.
