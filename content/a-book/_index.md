In a national design conference, my old design professor got up on stage and pronounced to a bunch of budding young designers "Design is Dead!". A few weeks later in class, despite the Dean stating he was under contract, he told us he was leaving the program for a b-school in the Mid-West. He founded the design program based on the notion that design is the rhetoric of things, and that unlike art, design could be taught systematically. This is an attempt to encapsulate everything I learned in the most digestible format I could think of (with some lessons I've learned since).
